# Python-Word-Match-Game
Word game:  Computer thinks of a four letter word and doesn't reveal. You need to guess the word in 10 chances or you will lose.  If the letters in your word matches the computer word exactly then its an exact match and if the letters are matched but jumbled then its a normal match. The 4 letter word is generated using randomly picked 4 letters and using NLTK library we check for the validity of the word.   Example 1: Computer word - take Your word     - make ----3EM (3 Exact matches, 'a','k' and 'e')  Example 2: Computer word - king Your Word     - cake -----1NM (1 Normal match, 'k')  Installations: pip install nltk  once its installed, import the statements that you will get on the console as an error and you are good to go.
